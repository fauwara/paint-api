# paint-api
an API to paint on a canvas, for me to learn more about API building ig.

## doc links for me:
### query data
[Flask Docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/)<br />
[Flask SQLAlchemy Docs](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/quickstart/#query-the-data)<br />
[SQLAlchemy Docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/tutorial/data_select.html)<br />

## TODO:
